## First Steps in programming with Python - Extracurricular Exercises
The "More Exercises" section in the testing platform of SoftUni contains additional problems that were not disucssed during the lection/excersises sessions. This folder houses my suggestions for solutions to this set of problems.

### 1. Trapezium face
Write a program that reads from the console three fractional numbers b1, b2 and h and calculates the face of a trapezoid with bases b1 and b2 and height h. The formula for the face of a trapezoid is (b1 + b2) * h / 2.
The figure below shows a trapezoid with sides 8 and 13 and height 7. It has a face of (8 + 13) * 7 / 2 = 73.5.
The answer must be formatted to the second digit after the decimal point.
